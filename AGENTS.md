# Project Rules
- Header files (like .h/.cuh etc) in `include`; Implementation files (like .c/.cpp/.cu etc) in `lib`.
- When splitting files, split them into multiple `.cpp`/`.h` files (not `.inc` includes).
- Projects under `externals` are external projects that are used in this project via source compilation, avoid modifying them.

## SystemVerilog Style Rules
- Every `begin`-`end` block must have a named label (`: label_name`).
- Loop variables must be declared at the top of the enclosing procedural block (`always`, `initial`, `function`), not inline in `for`. Use `iter_var0`, `iter_var1`, ... as loop variable names (numbered by nesting depth).

## EDA Tool Versions
- Synopsys DC: use `synopsys/syn/Y-2026.03`
- Verilator: use `verilator/5.044`
